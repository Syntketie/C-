This code calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The factorial function is defined to recursively compute the factorial. In the main function, the user is prompted to enter a number, which is then read using std::cin. The factorial function is called with the entered number, and the result is stored in the result variable. Finally, the calculated factorial is displayed using std::cout.
